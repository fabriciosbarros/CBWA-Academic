Guided Technology Project (Final Project)

Project Title: Time formatter

REQUIREMENTS:

You have been tasked to develop a system that delivers the time now in different formats and timezones. This system will based on microservices and will be designed to be hosted in a cloud environment.

Specific Requirements
The system is composed of 3 services:
• Aggregator
• Isodate formatter
• Utcdate formatter
The three components interact according to the following schema:

Using Java (Spring) and JavaScript and HTML build the three microserivces and the frontend.
• The services should communicate to each other ideally using JSON and the frontend, though it does not need to be very complex, needs to allow the user to request the ISO Date and the
UTC Date for a timestamp and get a response rendered on the screen without reloading the page (using AJAX).
